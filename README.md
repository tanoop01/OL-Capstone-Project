# Mental Health in the Tech Workplace: An Analytical Dashboard

## Overview

This project analyzes the 2014 OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness) Mental Health in Tech Survey data to uncover insights into the mental well-being of professionals in the tech industry. It features a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling for treatment-seeking behavior and age, and persona clustering to identify different employee attitudes towards mental health.

All these components are presented in an interactive web application built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface to explore the data and model predictions.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to:

-   **Visualize Key Trends**: Explore visualizations of demographics, workplace conditions, and attitudes towards mental health from the survey data.
-   **Predict Treatment Likelihood**: Use a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment based on their background and workplace environment.
-   **Estimate Respondent Age**: Predict a respondent's age based on their survey answers.
-   **Discover Employee Personas**: Use clustering to identify and understand different employee personas, such as "Open Advocates," "Under-Supported Professionals," and "Silent Sufferers."

## Dataset

The project uses the **OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey** dataset, which is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey). This dataset contains over 1,200 responses from tech employees, covering topics like:

-   Demographics (Age, Gender, Country)
-   Workplace environment (company size, remote work, tech company status)
-   Attitudes towards mental health (benefits, wellness programs, anonymity, leave policies)
-   Personal and family history of mental illness

## Features of the Dashboard

The Streamlit application is organized into several pages:

1.  **Introduction**: Provides context on the importance of mental health in the tech industry and outlines the project's goals.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A comprehensive gallery of plots and charts visualizing the distributions and relationships within the data.
3.  **Treatment Prediction**: An interactive form where users can input features to get a prediction on the likelihood of seeking treatment, complete with model confidence.
4.  **Age Prediction**: An interactive form to predict a respondent's age based on their workplace and health-related features.
5.  **Persona Clustering**: A visualization of employee personas and a tool to classify a user into a persona based on their inputs.

## Technologies Used

-   **Language**: Python
-   **Web Framework**: Streamlit
-   **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
-   **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
-   **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
